# NonadditivityAnalysis

Notebook for standardization of activity data, nonadditivity analysis and its evaluation.

A jupyter notebook for:

1. Cleaning and standardizing ChEMBL activity data
2. Running nonadditivity analysis based on NAA code published by C. Kramer [1]
3. Evaluating the nonadditivity results

## Installation

First, install a copy of the RDKit cheminformatics toolkit, available
from http://rdkit.org/. The easiest way is to install via PyPI with
`pip install rdkit-pypi`.

Install directly from source with:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/MolecularAI/NonadditivityAnalysis.git
```

Install the code in development mode with:

```bash
$ git clone git+https://github.com/MolecularAI/NonadditivityAnalysis.git
$ cd NonadditivityAnalysis
$ pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The jupyter notebook can be run directly with gzipped activity data downloaded from ChEMBL, 
as an example the activity data for ChEMBL1614027 (ChEMBL Version 27) is included in this package.
'my_path' and 'my_name' has to be adjusted at the beginning of the jupyter notebook to 
reflect the user's specific path and output name.
